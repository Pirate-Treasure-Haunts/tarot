# TAROT
Alchemical Tarot of the Human Condition

A modern, symbolic tarot system and companion software exploring inner states,
decision-making, and narrative meaning through a deliberately human-centred lens.

This repository contains the **core tarot deck data**, **card logic**, and
**cross-platform tooling** used to generate readings and explore the structure
of the deck.

The project is intentionally:
- reflective rather than predictive
- symbolic rather than mystical
- exploratory rather than prescriptive

No claims of divination, prophecy, or supernatural authority are made.

---

## ✨ What This Is

- A **106-card tarot deck**, including:
  - Traditional Major Arcana
  - Traditional Minor Arcana
  - A bespoke extended Major Arcana set
- A **software tool** that can:
  - draw cards programmatically
  - generate structured readings
  - support experimentation, remixing, and extension
- A **creative and reflective framework**, designed to be used for:
  - journaling
  - storytelling
  - personal reflection
  - symbolic analysis
  - artistic or narrative projects

---

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- Not fortune-telling
- Not spiritual authority
- Not psychological or medical advice
- Not deterministic or predictive

Interpretation is always the responsibility of the reader.

---

## 🖥️ Software Overview

The software component is a lightweight, cross-platform tool built to work
entirely offline.

### Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

Prebuilt binaries and installers are provided for convenience.
Source remains fully inspectable and rebuildable.

---

## 📦 Distribution Notes

- **Windows**: Installer and ZIP builds are provided.
- **Linux**: `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are provided.
- **macOS**: ZIP builds are provided.

macOS builds are currently **unsigned**, which means Gatekeeper may require
a one-time manual approval (right-click → Open).

This is expected behaviour for independent software distributed outside the
Mac App Store.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Tarot, here, is treated as:
- a **language of symbols**
- a **structured ambiguity**
- a tool for **sense-making**, not truth-assertion

Cards do not “mean” things on their own.
Meaning emerges from:
- context
- question
- reader
- interpretation

The deck is intentionally designed to support this process rather than replace it.

---

## 🔧 Modding & Experimentation

You are actively encouraged to:
- modify the deck
- remix card meanings
- extend the system
- write your own tooling
- fork and experiment

Streaming, screenshots, write-ups, and derivative works are welcome
(see LICENSE).

## ❤️ Final Note

This project is meant to be *used*, not revered.

If it helps you think, write, reflect, or create — it’s doing its job.

Built carefully, one layer at a time.
