## Scope

This project’s security scope is limited to:
- software correctness
- data integrity
- safe local execution

It does **not** claim:
- network hardening
- sandbox escape resistance
- protection against a compromised host system

---

## Verification

Users are encouraged to:
- inspect the source
- audit behaviour
- rebuild binaries themselves if desired

Transparency is a core design principle.
