              A 106-Card Exploratory Tarot Deck

---

Welcome — and thank you for exploring the Alchemical
Tarot of the Human Condition.

This project is a reimagining of the Tarot as a reflective,
psychological, and philosophical tool for contemporary life.
While it remains rooted in traditional Tarot structure, it
expands the deck to better address modern questions of
identity, power, authenticity, perception, and meaning.

This software presents the current complete structure of the
deck, totalling 106 cards, and is designed to be approachable
whether you are new to Tarot or already experienced.

# Deck Overview #
The deck is divided into four interconnected Arcana,
each addressing a different layer of human experience:

---

I. The Prime Arcana (22 cards)

These are the traditional Major Arcana, preserved in name
and count.

They represent foundational archetypes and large-scale life
movements — the deep currents beneath any reading.

Cards include:
The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, The Empress,
The Emperor, The Hierophant, The Lovers, The Chariot, Strength,
The Hermit, Wheel of Fortune, Justice, The Hanged Man, Death,
Temperance, The Devil, The Tower, The Star, The Moon, The Sun,
Judgment, The World.

These cards serve as the structural backbone of the deck.

---

II. The Human Arcana (20 cards)

This is where the deck becomes distinctly modern.
The Human Arcana explores inner psychological processes,
philosophical tensions, and social forces that shape how we act
and experience the world.

Each concept appears in two stages:
- Initiation: the first emergence or awareness
- Manifestation: the established, active form


The ten conceptual pairs are:
              _______________________________
-- The Shadow:
The Masked Penitent / The Cloaked Confessor
               ______________________________
-- The Persona:
The Jester’s Visage / The Guild Master’s Emblem
                     ________________________
-- The Will to Power:
The Iron Forger / The Ascent of the Serpent
                             ________________
-- The Repressed Unconscious:
The Sunken Crypt / The Whispering Well
            _________________________________ 
-- The Gaze:
The Unblinking Eye / The Stained Glass Witness
                      _______________________
-- The Symbolic Order:
The Script of the Scroll / The Grand Compiler’s Tome
                              _______________
-- Discipline/Power–Knowledge:
The Clockwork Overseer / The Panopticon Guard
                          ___________________
-- Authenticity/Bad Faith:
The Puppet’s Strings / The Actor’s Mirror
              _______________________________
-- The Absurd:
The Sisyphus Stone / The Broken Compass
             ________________________________
-- The Other:
The Unveiled Visage / The Threshold Glimmer
             ________________________________

These cards are designed to act as mirrors rather than predictions,
encouraging reflection rather than instruction.

How to Use This Deck

This Tarot is _not_ about telling you what will happen.

It _is_ designed to help you ask:
- What forces are shaping this situation?
- Where am I acting authentically — or not?
- What assumptions, pressures, or narratives are at play?

There is no “correct” reading — only useful ones.
